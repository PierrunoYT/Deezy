- **Folder structure** – Organize downloads in 4 layouts: Flat, Artist/Track, Artist/Album/Track, or Album/Track
- **Full metadata** – ID3v2.4 tags for MP3, Vorbis comments for FLAC (title, artist, album, album artist, year, track/disc number, genre, label, 1000×1000 cover art)
- **Quality options** – MP3 128, MP3 320, or FLAC with automatic fallback chain (FLAC → MP3_320 → MP3_128)
- **Quality transparency** – Completed downloads show requested quality vs actual downloaded quality when fallback occurs
- **Persistent history** – Download history saved to disk and restored on app restart
- **Open in file manager** – Click a downloaded track title in history to reveal the file in Explorer/Finder/Linux file manager
- **Export history** – Export download history as CSV or JSON with file picker dialog
- **CSRF auto-refresh** – Automatically retries downloads on token expiry with session refresh

### Customization
- **Theme system** – Light, Dark, and System themes with instant switching and OS theme detection
- **Custom themes** – Import/export custom theme files with JSON-based color definitions and theme manager UI
- **Example themes** – Three built-in custom themes (Sunset Orange, Forest Green, Midnight Blue)
- **Internationalization** – Full i18n support with English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, and Italian translations
- **Notifications** – System toast notifications for completed/failed downloads (reliable toggle with single-fire state change)
- **Keyboard shortcuts** – Comprehensive shortcuts (Ctrl+F search, Ctrl+1/2/3 navigation, Escape, Space, Shift+?, Ctrl+H minimize, Ctrl+,)
- **Accessibility improvements** – Keyboard-accessible modals/overlays, labeled icon buttons, improved form label associations, and guarded overlay keydown handlers that ignore events bubbling from inner elements

### System Integration
- **System tray** – Minimize to tray with menu, download status indicator, and quick controls (Ctrl+H to hide)
- **Auto-login** – Reconnects on app start using your saved ARL token
- **Settings persistence** – Preferences are saved in app data (JSON for non-secret settings; ARL stored in OS credential store) with validation
- **Account-aware quality** – Deezer Free accounts are restricted to MP3 128 kbps in the quality selector
- **Close to tray** – Optional setting to minimize to tray instead of closing the app

### Security
- **Credential storage** – ARL token stored in OS credential store (Windows Credential Manager / macOS Keychain / Linux Secret Service), not in plaintext files
- **Fail-closed secret persistence** – Settings saves now fail if credential-store writes fail; ARL is never intentionally written back to JSON as a fallback
- **Renderer-safe settings API** – `get_settings` redacts ARL from renderer responses; startup session restore is handled by a backend-only auto-login command
- **TLS hardened** – Minimum TLS 1.2 and HTTPS-only enforced on all HTTP connections
- **Request resilience** – Deezer HTTP client uses connection/read timeouts to avoid indefinite hangs
- **Download safety cap** – Per-track download size is capped (1 GiB) to reduce disk exhaustion risk from abnormal streams
- **Cover-art safety cap** – Album-cover downloads are capped at 10 MiB to reduce memory exhaustion risk
- **Panic hardening** – Crypto/decryption edge cases return errors instead of panicking (`expect`/unchecked slicing removed from download-critical paths)
- **XSS protection** – All user/API-facing HTML is sanitized; CSP restricts content sources
- **Path traversal protection** – Theme filenames validated against directory traversal attacks
- **Filename null-byte sanitization** – Generated filename/path components strip null bytes and reserved characters before writing files
- **CSV injection protection** – Exported CSV fields sanitized against spreadsheet formula injection
- **Input size guardrails** – Oversized search-history entries are ignored to prevent unbounded settings-file growth
- **Minimal permissions** – Tauri capabilities scoped to only required operations

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v18+)
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs) (latest stable)
- [Tauri v2 prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) (platform-specific dependencies)

### Get your Deezer ARL token

1. Log into [deezer.com](https://www.deezer.com)
2. Open DevTools (`F12`) → **Application** (Chrome) or **Storage** (Firefox) → **Cookies** → `https://www.deezer.com`
3. Copy the value of the `arl` cookie (192-character string)

> **Note:** Your ARL token is stored securely in your OS credential store (Windows Credential Manager / macOS Keychain / Linux Secret Service) and never shared. It expires periodically and will need to be updated.

### Build & run

```bash
cd deezy
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

The built application will be in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

## Architecture

### Frontend (Svelte 5)
- **Runes API** – Modern reactive state management with `$state`, `$effect`, and `$derived`; all components use Svelte 5 callback props (`onClose`, `onViewChange`, …) rather than Svelte 4 event directives
- **Component-based** – Modular UI components (SearchView, DownloadsView, SettingsView, etc.) with proper store subscription cleanup on unmount
- **Download queue** – Client-side queue manager with handle-based drag-and-drop reordering (drag lock resets after every drop) and priority management
- **Rate limiting** – Separate limiters for search (2 req/s) and download (3 concurrent) operations
- **Keyboard shortcuts** – Global shortcut system with registration, categories, and help modal; modals guard all keydown handlers with `target === currentTarget` to prevent inner-element keypresses from closing them unexpectedly
- **Audio player** – Mini player with seek bar, volume control, and playback state management
- **i18n** – svelte-i18n with 6 languages, formatters for duration/fans, and locale persistence

### Backend (Rust + Tauri)
- **DeezerClient** – HTTP client with ARL authentication, CSRF token management, and session handling
- **Blowfish CBC decryption** – Track decryption using Deezer's key derivation (MD5-based)
- **Quality fallback** – Automatic fallback chain: FLAC → MP3_320 → MP3_128
- **Metadata tagging** – ID3v2.4 for MP3 (id3 crate), Vorbis comments for FLAC (metaflac crate)
- **Cover art embedding** – Downloads 1000×1000 cover art and embeds in audio files
- **Folder structure** – Configurable directory organization with automatic creation
- **System tray** – Native tray icon with menu, status updates, and window management
- **Credential storage** – ARL stored in OS credential store via keyring crate; settings file contains no secrets
