### Fixed

- **DownloadsView**: Fixed `ReferenceError: unsubHistory is not defined` caused by invalid reactive statement that tried to reference `unsubHistory` before initialization; moved store subscription into `onMount` lifecycle function for proper initialization and cleanup
- **Navigation**: Fixed sidebar navigation buttons (Search, Settings) not switching views — problematic `$effect` block with store subscriptions was interfering with reactivity; moved subscriptions to `onMount` to restore proper view switching
- **SettingsView**: Fixed confusing empty ARL input field when already logged in — added visual indicator showing "ARL token is securely saved (hidden for security)" with updated placeholder text to clarify that the field is for updating the token

## [0.2.6] – 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- **DownloadsView**: Fixed invalid Svelte 5 prop syntax `{history=downloadItems}` → `history={downloadItems}` and replaced Svelte 4 `on:close` event directive with Svelte 5 `onClose` callback prop for `ExportHistoryModal`, which previously caused the modal close callback to never fire
- **SettingsView**: Fixed double-toggle bug on all three toggle switches (Notifications, Search History, System Tray) — `bind:checked` and the wrapper `onclick` were both mutating state on a single user click, causing the value to flip twice (no visible change); save functions no longer re-toggle state, label clicks stop propagation, and store subscriptions created in `onMount` are now properly unsubscribed on unmount
- **Sidebar**: Fixed user avatar fallback icon never being visible when `user.image` is falsy — `.avatar-fallback` CSS sets `display: none` by default (correct for image-error fallback) but the `{:else}` branch fallback was never overridden to `display: flex`
- **LyricsModal**: Fixed `onClose` being called twice when pressing Escape — both `window.addEventListener('keydown', …)` and `onkeydown` on the backdrop handled the same key; removed the redundant global listener; also added `target === currentTarget` guard to `handleBackdropKeydown` so pressing Enter on the Synced/Plain toggle buttons no longer bubbles up and closes the modal
- **QueueView**: Fixed `dragDisabled` never being reset to `true` after a completed drag-and-drop reorder, leaving the entire queue draggable from any point rather than only from the drag handle
- **SearchView**: Fixed missing `clearTimeout(searchTimeout)` in `onMount` cleanup, which could trigger `doSearch()` after the component was unmounted
- **ExportHistoryModal**: Fixed `handleOverlayKeydown` closing the modal when Enter is pressed inside the date inputs — added `event.target !== event.currentTarget` guard so only keypresses directly on the overlay backdrop are handled
- **Rate limiter timing**: Fixed timing drift in rate limiter where `lastCallTime` was updated after the wait period, causing slight cumulative delays over many calls; now updates timestamp correctly based on whether throttling occurred
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Simplified and fixed modifier key matching logic to require exact matches — shortcuts now properly distinguish between plain keys and modified keys (e.g., 'K' vs 'Ctrl+K')
- **Tray pause/resume**: Fixed tray pause/resume toggle only pausing queued downloads but not actively downloading tracks; added tracking of active download IDs so all downloads (active and queued) can be paused from the system tray

### Security

- **Settings hint XSS hardening** – Removed raw HTML rendering from the ARL hint in Settings (`{@html}` replaced with text interpolation) and updated locale strings to plain text
- **Null-byte filename sanitization** – Strips `\0` from generated filename/path components to prevent OS-level truncation issues
- **Cover-art memory guardrail** – Enforces a 10 MiB size cap for album-cover downloads to reduce memory-exhaustion risk from abnormal responses
- **Search history input cap** – Rejects oversized search-history entries (>500 bytes) to prevent unbounded settings-file growth

## [0.2.5] – 2026-02-22

### Added

- **New app logo and icons** – Replaced branding with the new `logodeezy.svg` design and regenerated Tauri icon assets (`.ico`, `.icns`, and PNG/Appx sizes) for desktop packaging
- **Startup splash screen** – Added branded startup screen with app logo and loading spinner, shown for a minimum duration before the app renders

### Fixed

- **Rust build warning cleanup** – Removed an unused trailing `downloaded` assignment in `download.rs` to eliminate `unused_assignments` warning during `tauri dev/build`
- **Startup transition polish** – Main UI now fades in smoothly after splash completion for cleaner app boot experience

## [0.2.4] – 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Languages** – Added Portuguese and Italian translations
- **Open downloaded songs from history** – Added clickable track titles in Downloads history that reveal the downloaded file in the OS file manager (Explorer/Finder/Linux file manager)

### Fixed

- **Downloads header actions styling** – Scoped status-row icon button styles to prevent them from overriding top-right header actions, fixing merged/stacked labels where `Export History`, `Clear history`, and `History` could render incorrectly
- **Windows file reveal from history** – Fixed `show_in_folder` Explorer invocation to use a Windows-safe absolute path and `explorer /select,` argument handling (including `\\?\` prefix cleanup), so clicking a downloaded track reveals the correct file instead of opening Documents
- **Free-account quality reporting** – Enforced effective quality selection in backend download command so free accounts request `MP3_128`; download history now avoids misleading `Requested MP3 320 -> Downloaded MP3 128` entries

### Documentation

- **README accuracy** – Updated Usage to include the Playlists tab and clarified settings persistence (non-secret settings in JSON, ARL in OS credential store)

## [0.2.3] – 2026-02-22

### Security

- **Credential fail-closed behavior** – `Settings::save` now requires successful OS credential-store writes and never falls back to persisting ARL in plaintext JSON
- **Renderer token exposure removed** – `get_settings` now redacts ARL before returning to the renderer process; new backend `auto_login` command handles session restore without exposing raw tokens
- **Crash hardening in crypto path** – Replaced panic-prone `expect` and unchecked slicing in download URL/decryption code with fallible error handling
- **Network/stream guardrails** – Added client connect/read timeouts and a 1 GiB per-track download safety cap to reduce hang/DoS risk
- **Safer export path handling** – Removed `unwrap()` when resolving save dialog paths during history export

### Fixed

- **MP4_RA3 file extension** – Fixed `get_quality_ext` returning `.mp3` for `MP4_RA3` quality; it now correctly returns `.mp4`, preventing ID3 tag writes to MP4 files
- **Missing Sunset Orange example theme** – `create_example_themes` now creates all three built-in themes (Sunset Orange, Forest Green, Midnight Blue) to match the example-themes directory and README
- **Dead code in download buffer handling** – Removed unreachable `buffer.len() == 2048` condition in the trailing-bytes section of `download_track`; the while-loop above guarantees `buffer.len() < 2048` at that point, so the decryption branch could never execute. Trailing partial chunks are correctly written as-is per Deezer's encryption scheme

### Documentation

- **README intro** – Corrected "SvelteKit 5" to "SvelteKit 2 + Svelte 5" in the introductory paragraph to match the actual dependency versions (`@sveltejs/kit ^2.9.0` + `svelte ^5.0.0`) and the Tech Stack table

## [0.2.2] – 2026-02-21

### Removed

- **Auto-update system** – Removed built-in auto-updater (Tauri updater plugin, update check on startup, update modal, "Check for Updates" button in Settings). Signing keys and signature generation are no longer required for builds

### Fixed

- **Download queue race condition** – Fixed race condition in queue processing that could cause downloads to stall when new items are added during processor flag transition. Added concurrency control to prevent multiple queue processors from running simultaneously
- **Keyboard shortcut logic** – Fixed inverted modifier key matching logic that prevented shortcuts without modifiers from working when any modifier key was pressed. Separated required and unwanted modifier checks for accurate shortcut detection
- **Audio player memory leak** – Added `destroy()` method to audio player manager with proper event listener cleanup. Event handlers are now stored as references and removed on cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- **Download decryption corruption** – Fixed critical bug where remaining buffer bytes after chunk processing were written without decryption check, potentially leaving encrypted data in downloaded files. Added proper decryption logic for partial chunks based on Deezer's encryption scheme
- **Download progress accuracy** – Fixed progress calculation that always incremented by 2048 bytes even when chunks were smaller, causing incorrect progress reporting. Now tracks actual chunk sizes for accurate download progress
- **Artist album track counts** – Hide "0 tracks" display when Deezer API doesn't provide track count data for artist discography albums
- **Settings accessibility** – Added ARIA roles and keyboard event handlers to toggle wrappers for notifications, search history, and system tray settings to resolve Svelte a11y warnings
- **Update checker** – Fixed "could not fetch a valid release json" error by updating release script to generate `latest.json` file with proper signature and metadata for Tauri updater plugin

## [0.2.1] – 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Playlist search & download** – New "Playlists" tab in search view to find and browse playlists, view tracks, and batch-download all tracks with one click

### Changed

- Resolve all Clippy warnings: remove needless borrow in `commands.rs`, use `.is_multiple_of()` in `download.rs`, derive `Default` for `FolderStructure` in `settings.rs`

### Fixed

- **i18n translation loading** – Fixed race condition where translation keys (e.g. `search.tabs.playlists`) were displayed as raw text instead of translated strings. Now properly awaits locale initialization using `waitLocale()` before rendering UI
- **Settings toggle buttons** – Fixed corrupted toggle switches for notifications, search history, and system tray where the purple circle overlapped text and buttons were non-functional. Restructured toggle component with separate wrapper for proper layout and click handling

## [0.2.0] – 2026-02-21

### Security

- Move ARL token storage from plaintext JSON to OS credential store (Windows Credential Manager / macOS Keychain / Linux Secret Service) with automatic migration
- Obfuscate Blowfish and AES cryptographic keys at rest in the binary (XOR deobfuscation at runtime)
- Generate real Ed25519/minisign updater signing keypair (replaces placeholder public key)
- Sanitize lyrics HTML output to prevent XSS injection from Deezer API data
- Add path traversal protection to theme load/save/delete operations (`sanitize_theme_name`)
- Restrict settings file permissions to `0600` on Unix to protect stored ARL token
- Disable `withGlobalTauri` to prevent exposing Tauri IPC on `window.__TAURI__`
- Remove all verbose `eprintln!` debug logging that could leak sensitive settings, user IDs, or session details
- Add CSV formula injection protection to download history export (`sanitize_csv_field`)
- Enforce minimum TLS 1.2 and HTTPS-only on the HTTP client
- Remove overly broad `process:default` Tauri capability, scope to `process:allow-restart` only
